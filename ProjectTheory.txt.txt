Counter App Theory:

HTML Use

The Counter App's fundamental structure is established by the HTML code.
It consists of the <head> and <body> sections, the opening and closing <html> tags, and the document type declaration (<!DOCTYPE html>).
Character set, viewport parameters, and compatibility are defined using meta tags.
<link> and <script> elements are used, respectively, to link external CSS and JavaScript files.

CSS Use 

The Counter App elements are styled using the CSS code.
The * selector sets the box-sizing to border-box for all items and resets outlines, padding, and margins.
Flexbox is used to center the content of the body, which is designed to occupy the entire viewport height.
The primary app container is styled with flex attributes, padding, box shadow, and background color by the.container class.
Bold text, font size, and padding are examples of button styles.
The display value is styled with a border, padding, and font size by the #displayValue ID.

Java Script Use 

The Counter App has additional capabilities thanks to JavaScript.
Document is used to select HTML elements.obtainElementById.
The increment, reset, and decrement buttons now have event listeners attached to them.
It verifies the current value for both increment and decrement, changes it appropriately within predetermined bounds, and displays an alert for limitations.
With each click of the reset button, the backdrop color is randomly changed and the display value is set to 0.
Hexadecimal colors are generated at random via the randomColor function.
When the reset button is clicked, the changeRandomColor function is triggered, which modifies the body's background color.


How to Produce:

Make the following three files: script.js, style.css, and index.html.
In each file, copy the corresponding code portions.
Make sure the JavaScript and CSS files are linked from the HTML file.
To access the Counter App, open the HTML file in your browser.
To increase, decrease, or reset the counter, click the buttons; when you reset it, you can see the backdrop color change.


This Counter App is a basic example of how to use JavaScript for interactivity, CSS for styling, and HTML for structure.
